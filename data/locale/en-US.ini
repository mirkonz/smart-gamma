SmartGamma.UsageTitle="Smart Gamma usage"
SmartGamma.UsageText.Auto="Auto brightness watches your scene and adds more gamma, brightness, contrast, and saturation as soon as it gets darker than the darkness threshold. Bright scenes stay exactly as they are."
SmartGamma.UsageText.Manual="Threshold fade waits until the scene stays under the darkness threshold for the delay you set, fades the effect in, and fades back out once things brighten."
SmartGamma.ModuleDescription="Smart Gamma shader filter that automatically boosts visibility in dark scenes."
SmartGamma.FilterName="Smart Gamma"
SmartGamma.Param.DarknessThreshold="Darkness threshold"
SmartGamma.Param.DarknessThreshold.Description="Sets the brightness level (0 = black, 100 = white) where Smart Gamma starts working. Lower values reserve it for darker scenes."
SmartGamma.Param.ShowDetectedLuminance="Show detected brightness"
SmartGamma.Param.ShowDetectedLuminance.Description="Toggle the read-only detected brightness indicator if you prefer a quieter UI."
SmartGamma.Param.CurrentLuminance="Detected brightness"
SmartGamma.Param.CurrentLuminance.Value="Detected average luminance: %.1f%% (smoothed over a short window)."
SmartGamma.Param.Mode="Mode"
SmartGamma.Param.Mode.Description="Choose whether Smart Gamma scales continuously as scenes darken (Auto brightness) or sticks to the original trigger/hold/fade behavior (Threshold fade)."
SmartGamma.Param.Mode.Auto="Auto brightness"
SmartGamma.Param.Mode.Threshold="Threshold fade"
SmartGamma.Param.ThresholdDuration="Threshold duration (ms)"
SmartGamma.Param.ThresholdDuration.Description="How long the scene must stay darker (to fade in) or brighter (to fade out) before manual mode reacts."
SmartGamma.Param.FadeIn="Fade in (ms)"
SmartGamma.Param.FadeIn.Description="How many milliseconds manual mode takes to ease from off to full strength once it kicks in."
SmartGamma.Param.FadeOut="Fade out (ms)"
SmartGamma.Param.FadeOut.Description="How many milliseconds the effect takes to fade back to normal once the scene brightens."
SmartGamma.Param.Gamma="Gamma boost"
SmartGamma.Param.Gamma.Description="Maximum gamma boost at full strength. Higher numbers lift shadows; Auto brightness ramps toward this."
SmartGamma.Param.Brightness="Brightness offset"
SmartGamma.Param.Brightness.Description="Extra brightness added at full strength. Use small positive values to avoid clipping; Auto brightness eases into it."
SmartGamma.Param.Contrast="Contrast"
SmartGamma.Param.Contrast.Description="Contrast boost at full strength to keep highlights defined while the effect is active."
SmartGamma.Param.Saturation="Saturation"
SmartGamma.Param.Saturation.Description="Color boost applied as the effect ramps up; set to 1.0 to leave color alone."
